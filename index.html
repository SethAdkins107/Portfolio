        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I hope to be a well-rounded, adventurous individual and to display myself here. 
            I am interested in pursuing a job that allows me to continue to solve problems and create, primarily in software development. 
            I am also very intrigued by many things, really anything that helps me understand this world, from filosophy to video games to sports to travel.
            Thanks for taking the time to peruse what I've found and what I've made. It means a lot.</p>
